after we import libraries likes numpy pandas matplotlib.pyplot
we create 2 entities
first one is matrix of features and the second one is the dependent variable vector

very first important priciple in machine learning:
in any dataset with which you are gonna train a machine learning
model you have the same entities which are the features and the dependent variable vector. features are the columns with which you
are going to predict the dependent variable
